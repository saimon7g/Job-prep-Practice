// There is an array initially containing n numbers. then each of the numbers of the array is multiplied by 2. Now the array is 2 * n size and each element of the array gets shuffled. You are given the shuffled array of size 2 * n. You have to restore the original array.

// Here are some LeetCode problems that are conceptually similar, involving array manipulations, transformations, and recovering original sequences:

// LeetCode 1488: Avoid Flood in The City
// This problem involves recovering the sequence of events based on certain constraints, much like restoring the original array after a transformation. It focuses on handling floods by controlling where rain will fall and finding the right sequence to prevent overflow.

// LeetCode 2054: Two Out of Three
// This problem asks for elements that appear in at least two of three arrays, similar to handling two different forms of the same data and finding a connection between them.

// LeetCode 2295: Replace Elements in an Array
// This problem involves transforming an array based on replacements. The transformation aspect is similar to how in your problem the array was multiplied and shuffled.

// LeetCode 186: Reverse Words in a String II
// Though different in nature, this problem requires manipulating an array of characters to restore an original form (reversed words in this case). The restoration aspect relates to your problem.

// LeetCode 48: Rotate Image
// This is another transformation-based problem where you need to rotate a 2D matrix (which can be seen as an array of arrays). The task involves rearranging elements to get the original or transformed version.

// LeetCode 565: Array Nesting
// In this problem, you are given a shuffled array and need to identify certain subsets (or nests) of numbers, focusing on re-arranging and recovering sequences within the array.

// LeetCode 645: Set Mismatch
// This involves finding a pair of numbers from an array that has been transformed in a way, and you need to restore the correct set by identifying a duplicated number and a missing one.
