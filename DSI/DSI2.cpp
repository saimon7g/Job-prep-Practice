// Given n inputs each with n bits. Output a number not given which has n bits too.

// Here are some LeetCode problems that are conceptually similar to constructing a distinct 
// 𝑛
// n-bit number that differs from given 
// 𝑛
// n-bit inputs:

// LeetCode 89: Gray Code
// In this problem, you are asked to generate the sequence of Gray codes, which are 
// 𝑛
// n-bit numbers where each successive number differs from the previous one by exactly one bit. The bit manipulation and uniqueness aspects align with the idea of generating a number distinct from the given ones.

// LeetCode 1239: Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters
// This problem involves constructing a unique string by concatenating strings that don't share characters. The concept of building a distinct entity from given elements has a similar underlying principle.

// LeetCode 268: Missing Number
// This problem asks to find the missing number from a sequence of integers, which is analogous to constructing a number that doesn’t exist in the given input.

// LeetCode 1913: Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs
// While different in terms of problem statement, this involves finding unique elements and forming distinct pairs, somewhat related to the concept of constructing distinct combinations.

// LeetCode 784: Letter Case Permutation
// This problem generates all possible permutations of a string by flipping the case of the characters. It shares a similarity in how you flip bits or characters to create new possibilities, akin to how the distinct number is created by flipping bits.

// LeetCode 247: Strobogrammatic Number II
// This problem is about generating numbers that look the same when rotated 180 degrees, which involves ensuring uniqueness in number generation similar to your problem of creating distinct 
// 𝑛
// n-bit numbers.

// LeetCode 137: Single Number II
// This problem asks to find a unique number in an array where every other number appears three times. The focus on finding a distinct number based on bit manipulation has similarities.
