// // Given two numbers represented as arrays of characters in decimal format, add them and return the result in the same format. For example, Input: ['1', '2', '3'] and ['4', '5', '6'] Output: Output: ['5', '7', '9']

// LeetCode 415: Add Strings
// Problem: Given two non-negative integers represented as strings, return the sum of these integers, also represented as a string. The input strings are large, and you are not allowed to use any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger).

// Description: This problem involves adding two strings representing large numbers in a manner similar to how you would perform addition manuallyâ€”by adding digit by digit from the right side, carrying over any excess.
